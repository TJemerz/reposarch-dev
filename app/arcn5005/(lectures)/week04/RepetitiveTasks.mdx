## Repetitive task in the architectural practice ✏️🤖

## <br/>

- When working on a digital architectural project, there are some tasks that we do every day that are intensively repetitive
- These tasks normally get assigned to the new/younger intern
- Nobody likes doing robotic tasks for an extended period of time
- Dynamo is a tool that had the potential to automate some of these tasks for autodesk Revit
