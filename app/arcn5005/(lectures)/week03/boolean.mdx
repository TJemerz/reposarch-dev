## Boolean operations ðŸ§Š

- There are three basic Boolean operations:

  1. Union (Unite, join) - the operation combines two volumes included in the different solids into a single solid.
  2. Intersection - the operation keeps only the volume common to both solids
  3. Subtract (cut) - the operation subtracts the volume of one solid from the other solid object.
