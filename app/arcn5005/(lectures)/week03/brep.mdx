## Boundary Representation (B-rep) ðŸ§Š

- A solid model is formed by defining the surfaces that form its boundary (edges and surfaces)
- The face of a B-rep represents an oriented surface, there are two sides to the surface; solid side (inside) and void side (outside), unlike faces in a wireframe.
- B-rep model is created using Euler operation
- Many Finite Element Method (FEM) programs use this method. Allows the interior meshing of the volume to be more easily controlled.
