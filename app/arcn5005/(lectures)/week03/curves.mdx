## Curve properties ➰

- **Control Points:** List of at least Degree+1 Points. One of the easiest ways to change the shape of a NURBS Curve is to move its Control Points.
- **Weight:** When a Curve’s Control Points all have the same weight (usually 1), the Curve is called non-rational, otherwise the Curve is called rational. Most NURBS curves are non-rational. Usually positive numbers.
- **Knots:** List of (Degree+N-1) numbers, where N is the number of Control Points. Used together with the weights to control the influence of the Control Points on the resulting Curve.
