## Benefits of CAD 💻✔️

- **Quicker design processes:** Designers can create prototypes in mere hours
- **Cost effective:** There’s no need to manufacture physical prototypes when you can use CAD to create hundreds of prototypes that can be improved upon without any cost
- **Ease of use:** CAD programs can be easy to pick up on, and they allow for repeated designs and 2D or 3D drawings
- **No restrictions:** With how sophisticated and complex some CAD programs have become, design is slowly becoming limitless
