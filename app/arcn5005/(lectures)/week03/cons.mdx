## Cons of CAD 💻❌

- **Software can be expensive:** Buying a CAD program can set you back a lot. Of course, your budget depends on whether you’re a hobbyist or you’re running an entire business
- **Training can be expensive:** If you’re running a business, you won’t want to fork out for staff training for a particular CAD program
- **Errors are still possible:** Despite how much CAD has evolved and how sophisticated many programs are, it’s still possible to make errors
